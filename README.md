I built a Movie Recommendation System that suggests similar movies based on the description of a selected movie. I used TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for content-based recommendations. Then I integrated TMDB API to fetch real-time posters, overviews, and ratings, with proper error handling for missing data or network failures. The frontend is built in Streamlit, where users can select a movie and get an interactive recommendation list. This project demonstrates Machine Learning, API integration, and frontend skills together.
